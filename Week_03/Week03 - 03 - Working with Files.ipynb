    "A text file is a file that contains charaster or string data. Openning a text file in a text editor will display the file. Some exmaples of bioinformatics text documents include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- FASTA files of DNA or protein sequences\n",
    "- files containing output from command-line programs (e.g. BLAST)\n",
    "- FASTQ files containing DNA sequencing reads\n",
    "- HTML files\n",
    "- word processing documents\n",
    "- and of course, Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, many other files will be binary files â€“ ones which are not made up of characters and lines, but of bytes. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- BAM files\n",
    "- image files (JPEGs and PNGs)\n",
    "- audio files\n",
